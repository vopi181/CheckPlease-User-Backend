# CheckPlease User Backend

# 03/2023 Update
This was the backend POC for an app that allowed users to scan an NFC tag and checkout at restaurants and other venues. Built with Go, PostgreSQL, and gRPC. Last actual commits to this repo were years ago. Some low-hanging fruit (DB query optimization, etc) was not fully implemented when this repo was activily being worked on.
